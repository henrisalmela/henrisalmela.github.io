				<h2>Who am I
				</h2>
				<p>
				I am now 26 years old, born in the south-east of Finland, but since moved to Helsinki. I have been studying health informatics at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, where I am just about to graduate from. The goal now is to start a career in UX design, where I am aiming to specialize in Interaction design or User research. 
				<br><br>In personal life I enjoy photography, travelling, good food and hanging out with my fianc√©e and two dogs.

			<h3>Where I am now...</h3>
			<p >
			In addition to IT and programming, my education has been comprised of service, user experience, and human-centred design related topics that have played a major role in my studies. There is also where my main interest lies. My enthusiasm for these topics has driven me to educate myself even further through textbooks that I have hoarded for the last year, and also online courses in Lynda.com and Youtube. I have also activated on signing myself in for projects to develop and test my design skills, one of which was Kohdataan -hackathon.<br>
			I rearly find subjects I am truly passionate about, but is one.

		<div id="left-column">
			<h3>and where I want to be</h3>
			<p>My goal is to become a UX professional and be a part of creating better services and solutions for people. Poorly designed services, online and in real world have made me realize how important it is to consider every step, and leave nothing depending on luck. I have seen how potentially excellent products have made faceplants due to ignorance and lack of empathy, and this is something that I want to fix and make an impact on.
